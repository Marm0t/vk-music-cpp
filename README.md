# VK-MUSIC

**NOTE: Due to the [update of VK API](https://vk.com/dev/audio_api) that disables access to audio methods starting from December 2016 this tool is not working anymore.**

Fast and easy way to download music from [vk.com](https://vk.com/).

Just choose the folder to store your music, select audiofiles you want to download and click _Download selected_.

That's it! 

Take a coffe and wait until download is complete.

If you need only one of your vk.com audios - just click the link and song will be downloaded.
